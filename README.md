# Description
This project aims to build a portable and affordable personal muscle monitoring system, consisting of a wearable device containing EMG(Electromyography) sensors to track muscle signals and a mobile application (Android) to assist users in preventing muscle injuries during workouts or in daily life. The wearable device transmits real-time EMG data to the mobile application for signal analysis. When a drop in the median frequency in EMG is detected, the application will prompt the user to cease further activity to prevent injury. A TensorFlow model was included to classify the actions being taken by the user.

The technology used for this project are: Java, Android, BLE, C++, Arduino, TensorFlow.

IDE Used: Android Studios, Arduino IDE
